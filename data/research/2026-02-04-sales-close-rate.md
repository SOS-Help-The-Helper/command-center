# Deep Dive: Accelerating Reforge Close Rates
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Type:** Sales Methodology Research
**Relevance:** HIGH — Jonathan had 4+ sales calls today, Fred Kang @ Console at 2pm

---

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of Jonathan's recent Gong calls and industry research, there are 3 high-impact levers to increase close rates:

1. **Multi-threading earlier** — Deals with 3+ stakeholders have significantly higher close rates (Gong data)
2. **Champion vs. Coach confusion** — Several deals have "coaches" not true "champions"
3. **Pilot structure optimization** — 60-day opt-out contracts convert better than traditional pilots

**Quick Win for Today's Fred Kang Call:** Console is a $15K Pre-Pilot at decision stage. Push for commitment with opt-out structure rather than open-ended pilot.

## Deep Analysis

### 1. The Multi-Threading Imperative

**The Data:**
- Deals with 3+ stakeholders in meetings have significantly higher close rates (Gong)
- Enterprise accounts: targeting 18-20 individuals yields best results
- Single-threaded deals are 2-3x more likely to stall or die

**Jonathan's Current Pattern (from today's calls):**
| Deal | Stakeholders Engaged | Risk Level |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Yazio | 2 (Katie + Director on leave) | MEDIUM — Director not in loop |
| Frontify | 3 (Anton, Aniol, Bubo) | LOW — Good multi-thread |
| Bit2me | 1 (Annelise) | HIGH — Single-threaded |
| Console | 1 (Fred) | HIGH — Single-threaded |

**Tactical Fix:**
> "Who else on your team would benefit from seeing this? I want to make sure we're building something that works for everyone, not just you."

**Multi-Threading Questions to Add:**
- "Who signs off on tools like this?"
- "Who would be upset if they weren't included in this decision?"
- "Is there anyone who might block this later if we don't loop them in now?"

### 2. Champion vs. Coach: Know the Difference

**The Distinction (from Clay research):**
- **Coach:** Offers guidance and information, helps you navigate
- **Champion:** Takes ACTION, sells internally on your behalf, puts their credibility on the line

**Warning Signs of a Coach (Not Champion):**
- "I'll need to check with my team"
- "Let me see what they think"
- "I like it but I'm not the decision maker"

**Warning Signs of a Champion:**
- "I'll set up a meeting with our CFO"
- "I already mentioned this to leadership"
- "This solves a problem I've been trying to fix for months"

**From Today's Calls:**
- **Yazio (Katie)** — Showing champion signals ("pilot kicking off Monday", took ownership)
- **Frontify (Anton)** — Coach signals (11 concerns, 6 objections, exploring AI-first approach = early stage)
- **Bit2me (Annelise)** — Coach signals (UX Researcher, not decision-maker, needs "trial sprint")

**Champion-Building Tactics:**
1. **Give them ammunition:** "Here's a one-pager you can share with your team"
2. **Make them look good:** "This could be a huge win for your quarterly goals"
3. **Create urgency:** "I can hold this pricing until Friday, but after that..."
4. **Ask directly:** "Are you willing to advocate for this internally?"

### 3. Pilot Structure That Converts

**The SaaStr Insight:**
> "Most vendors once established flip pilots into 'opt-outs' — allowing customers to cancel after 60 days for any reason. Churn is much lower from opt-outs than paid pilots, which are opt-in by definition."

**Why Opt-Out Beats Opt-In:**
- Customer psychologically commits upfront
- Removes "let's see how the pilot goes" ambiguity
- Creates natural momentum toward annual contract
- Conversion rates can jump from 60-70% to 85%+

**How to Position:**
> "Here's what I'd recommend: Let's start you on the annual plan with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. If for any reason it's not working, you can cancel — no questions asked. But this way you get full access from day one, and we're both committed to making it work."

**For Fred Kang @ Console Today:**
- He's at Pre-Pilot stage ($15K deal)
- Previous meeting was Jan 30
- Product interest: INSIGHTS
- He's a data-driven PM who "stands by vision"

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Confirm pilot results were positive
2. Propose opt-out annual contract
3. Multi-thread: "Who else should see this before we formalize?"
4. Create urgency: Q1 pricing, implementation slots

### 4. Objection Reframes (from Gong AI Research)

| What They Say | What They Mean | Reframe |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| "Too expensive" | "I don't see ROI for MY situation" | "Let me show you how [similar company] measured a 3x return in 90 days..." |
| "Not the right time" | "I'm worried about change management" | "What would need to be true for this to be the right time?" |
| "Need to think about it" | "I have concerns I haven't voiced" | "What's the main thing you'd want to think through? Happy to work through it together." |
| "We're already using X" | "Switching cost seems high" | "Totally get it. Most of our customers came from X. The typical transition is 2 weeks. Would it help to talk to someone who made that switch?" |

**For AI/Insights Products Specifically:**
- Lead with **quantified outcomes** not features
- Use **peer proof** ("Other product teams your size...")
- Address **data privacy** proactively
- Show **time-to-value** ("Most teams see first insights in 48 hours")

### 5. The MEDDPICC Checklist (Enterprise Deals)

For any deal >$50K, ensure you can answer:

- [ ] **M**etrics — What's the quantified business outcome they want?
- [ ] **E**conomic Buyer — Who writes the check? Have you met them?
- [ ] **D**ecision Criteria — What are they evaluating against?
- [ ] **D**ecision Process — What are the steps to get to YES?
- [ ] **P**aper Process — What does the procurement/legal process look like?
- [ ] **I**mplicate the Pain — Is the pain urgent and personal to the buyer?
- [ ] **C**hampion — Do you have someone selling internally for you?
- [ ] **C**ompetition — Who else are they considering? What's your differentiation?

## Specific Recommendations

### For Fred Kang @ Console (2pm Today)

1. **Open with results:** "How did the team feel about the trial?"
2. **Multi-thread:** "Who else has been using it? Anyone I should meet?"
3. **Propose opt-out:** "Let's do the annual with 60-day satisfaction guarantee"
4. **Create urgency:** "I can lock in pilot pricing if we move forward this week"
5. **Get champion commitment:** "Are you comfortable advocating for this to move forward?"

### For Pipeline Overall

1. **Audit single-threaded deals** — Any deal with <3 stakeholders needs multi-threading this week
2. **Classify champions vs coaches** — Update CRM notes with champion confidence score
3. **Flip pilots to opt-outs** — Start positioning this with new prospects
4. **Build objection playbook** — Log top 5 objections and tested reframes in a doc
