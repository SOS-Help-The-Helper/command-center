## 🎯 YOUR 3 PRIORITIES TODAY

### 1. LITMOS - Your Champion Is Now CEO 🚨
**MAJOR UPDATE:** Michelle Benfer was appointed **CEO of Litmos** in July 2025. Your main contact now runs the entire company.

**Context:**
- Michelle: Former HubSpot SVP Sales Americas (5.5 years), then FP Operating Partner, now CEO
- 18+ meetings together since Oct 2025
- Harmony audit delivered Dec 2025
- **Last contact:** Jan 27 — 7 days ago, momentum at risk

**Why this is massive:**
- CEO sponsor for both Harmony AND Reforge deals
- She hinted at potentially bringing you in as Operating Partner to FP portfolio
- Success here → opens entire Francisco Partners portfolio

**Action TODAY:**
- [ ] Send congratulations/reconnect message to Michelle
- [ ] Reference great Harmony work, ask about Phase 2
- [ ] Bridge to Reforge Insights conversation
- [ ] Read full research: `~/clawd/memory/research/litmos-deep-dive.md`

### 2. DI GLOBAL - Resolve or Refund (48h)
**Why it matters:** $15K at risk, 13 weeks overdue, refund requested Jan 29. Client trust and cash flow both on the line.

**The Decision:**
Either deliver value THIS WEEK or process the refund. No middle ground.

**What I know:**
- Client: Orly Ben Eliyahu (orly.b@diglobal.tech)
- Company: Dynamic Infrastructure (civil infrastructure maintenance)
- Engagement: HubSpot workshops (last: Jan 29)
- Issue: 13 weeks overdue on deliverables

**What I need from you:**
- What was the original SOW/scope?
- What's been delivered vs outstanding?
- Can you deliver meaningful value by Friday, or refund?

**Options:**
1. **Deliver:** Identify 1-2 high-impact deliverables, ship by Friday, save relationship
2. **Refund:** Process $15K refund, write off the relationship, free up mental space

---

### 3. SOS MVP - Remove One Blocker
**Why it matters:** June $275K milestone depends on showing value. Aid Arena is waiting.

**Current state:** 75% complete. Core matching works.

**The blocker:** Need to set `slack_channel_id` for Helene disaster so match announcements post to the right channel.

**Action:**
- [ ] Get the Aid Arena Slack channel ID where matches should post
- [ ] Run this SQL (I'll handle):
```sql
UPDATE disasters 
SET slack_channel_id = 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ID' 
WHERE id = 'helene-wnc-2024';
```
