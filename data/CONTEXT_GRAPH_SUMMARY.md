## Key Insight for Jonathan

**Litmos is your best Reforge lead.** They're a B2B SaaS LMS with high customer feedback volume (enterprise training platforms get tons of support tickets, course reviews, NPS data). Colin Hegwood (CX) would be the natural champion for Reforge Insight Analytics.

You're already deeply embedded with the team through your GTM audit work. A warm intro to their product/CX team for Reforge could be very warm.
