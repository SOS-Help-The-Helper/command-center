Planned for plan mode improvements Possibility for prototypes that can be handed to another coding agent later. (e.g exporting structured specs/context for engineers or their coding agents.)

Context Setting Goal:  Understand their situation before testing the problem hypothesis Business Model \"Tell me about your business. What do you build, who do you sell to, what's your go-to-market like?\" Listening for:  B2B vs B2C, complexity, whether they have direct customer access Their Role + Team Structure \"What's your role, and how is your product/discovery team structured?\" \"How many people on product vs. engineering?\" \"Do you have dedicated researchers, or is discovery part of PM work?\" Listening for:  Resource constraints, maturity level, whether discovery is professionalized AI Maturity \"Are you using AI tools in your engineering workflow? (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)\" \"How much has that changed your shipping velocity?\" Listening for:  Do they actually have the gap? (Fast eng without fast discovery only matters if they've accelerated eng) 2. Process Goal:  Understand how discovery actually works for them, not how it should work Current Discovery Process \"Walk me through what happens from idea to 'ready to build.' What does that actually look like?\" Let them describe it end-to-end without interrupting. Listening for: Manual:  Are they doing things by hand that could be automated? (Scheduling calls, pulling data, compiling feedback) Fragmented:  Are they bouncing between tools? (Slack, Figma, Notion, spreadsheets, Amplitude) Limited resources:  Are they bottlenecked on researcher time, PM time, customer access? Multiple products:  Are they validating one direction at a time, or exploring multiple? Time sinks:  Where do they lose weeks? (Research scheduling, synthesis, stakeholder alignment) Specificity Check \"Can you walk me through a recent feature? From initial idea to launch, how long did that take and what did the discovery process actually look like?\" Listening for:  Real friction points, not abstract ones What's Bottlenecking Them \"In that process, where do you lose the most time?\" \"Is it scheduling customer calls, synthesizing feedback, exploring options, getting stakeholder alignment, or something else?\" 3. Consequences Goal:  Understand the actual cost of poor discovery for them What Happens When You Don't Validate \"What happens if you ship something without proper validation?\" Let them answer first. Don't lead. Listening for: Speed/rework:  Do features get re-scoped mid-build or after launch? Time cost:  How much eng time goes to fixing vs. building new?

    "text": "Strategic Sales Playbook for Reforge Insights From acquisition to acceleration: Your roadmap to exceeding targets Reforge's January 2025 acquisition of Monterey AI positions the company at the intersection of AI-powered analytics and customer feedback intelligence. With internal data showing a 27.8% win rate across 180 deals and $2.4M in total pipeline, this playbook synthesizes comprehensive market research with proven sales patterns to accelerate your success as a new Account Executive. The strategic opportunity you're stepping into The customer feedback analytics market presents an exceptional growth opportunity, with the total addressable market reaching  $14.82 billion in 2025 and projected to hit $35.37 billion by 2030  at a 19% compound annual growth rate. More importantly,  70% of CX leaders plan to integrate generative AI into their customer touchpoints by 2026 , creating urgent demand for AI-powered feedback solutions. This timing coincides perfectly with Reforge's strategic expansion through the Monterey AI acquisition. Brian Balfour, Reforge's founder and CEO, identified what he calls the \"Feedback Fragmentation Tax\" - a critical problem where product teams collect vast amounts of qualitative customer data scattered across 10+ tools, leading to wasted time, poor product decisions, and technical debt. This pain point resonates strongly in the market, as evidenced by  Garry Tan, President of Y Combinator, declaring that \"Every PM and CEO should use @montereyai\"  and calling it \"truly essential product analytics.\" The solution aggregates scattered feedback sources, applies AI-powered analysis to surface unique opportunities, and delivers insights directly into existing team workflows through integrations with Jira, Slack, Notion, and 20+ other platforms. Your internal sales data reveals important patterns to leverage. The  44.4% win rate for small deals ($0-5K)  significantly outperforms the 20.4% rate for medium deals and 34.1% for large deals, suggesting a land-and-expand strategy could be highly effective. Additionally, Brian Balfour's personal involvement correlates with a 34.1% win rate across 41 deals, indicating the power of executive engagement, while the NY Times' 100% win rate demonstrates strong enterprise potential when properly positioned. Your competitive positioning advantage The competitive landscape analysis reveals clear differentiation opportunities against established players.  ProductBoard charges $59-75 per maker per month  with AI features costing an additional $20 per user, while their enterprise deals often reach $70,000-100,000 annually. In contrast, Reforge Insights offers  unlimited user seats with consumption-based pricing , eliminating the per-seat penalty that makes competitors increasingly expensive as organizations grow. This becomes a powerful differentiator when speaking with growing companies concerned about scaling costs. Against Enterpret, which also offers unlimited users and custom AI models, Refor",

Also nice that up-front work which produces better outputs can help reduce credit cost. Inthe next few weeks we'll be leaning HARD into plan mode, making that a primary means for interacting with the product. Team/credit model (pooled credits, editor/viewer roles, predictable usage) We're going to be set up for this with teams launch Easy capture of feedback (i.e. commenting pinned to elements of the prototype) Improvements planned but TBD on timing What she wanted: Some form of component/design-system capability This is still TBD - we're evaluating this for an extension feature Additional lightweight heuristic evaluation of early prototypes. Planned for plan mode improvements Possibility for prototypes that can be handed to another coding agent later. (e.g exporting structured specs/context for engineers or their coding agents.) This is in planning mode - we are working on handoff capability sometime in Q1 Possibility of exporting to Figma for production design. This is lower priority but we are looking at different integrations Tab 2 Head of UX - Ityam Team size? Adam Green Call Key Discussion Points: 1. Company Overview: Ityam Deshpande from Albert Invent, a pre-series B startup (128 employees) in chemical and material science, leads a design team of 4, growing to 5-10, and a similar-sized PM team. 2. AI Initiative Goal: Ityam is spearheading an initiative to integrate AI tools into their end-to-end design process, moving from ad-hoc explorations to a structured approach for efficiency. 3. Four Key Phases for AI Integration: The initiative focuses on Discovery/Problem Validation, Design Iterations/Prototyping, Documentation/Handoff (especially Figma plugins for niche content and annotations), and User Research (quantitative usability testing, qualitative interviews, heuristic evaluation). 4. Build's Differentiator: Adam Green highlights Build's use of Cloud Code as its coding agent, which is superior for reliability and context chunking compared to custom agents used by competitors like Figma Make and Alloy, though it might be slightly slower initially. 5. Credit Usage Optimization: Build recently rebalanced credit usage, making actions 5-10x cheaper, especially follow-up prompts, and optimized initial extension interactions to reduce cost. 6. Team Features & Credit Sharing: Build is launching team features in Q1, allowing pooled credits and role-based permissions (editor vs. viewer) to manage usage, with viewers still having free credits for basic interaction. 7. Roadmap for Planning/Chat Mode: Build plans to introduce a more chat-based \"ask mode\" for reasoning and discussion before code generation, which will be much cheaper in terms of credit cost. 8. Design System Integration: Build is evaluating two directions for component libraries: an internal system capturing DOM elements or integration with external sources like",

    "text": "Constant Contact / Reforge Insights Objective Establish Constant Contact's systematic Voice of Customer program by consolidating fragmented feedback sources across sales, support, user research, and external review sites into a unified AI-powered platform that delivers real-time customer insights directly to product teams. This deployment will eliminate the current manual synthesis bottlenecks that leave the product organization operating without customer input, while providing self-serve access to personalized feedback streams that integrate seamlessly into existing product development workflows, ultimately enabling data-driven decision making at the speed required for Q4 planning and beyond. Current Challenges (As We Heard Them) No formal VOC Program  - there's no actual customer insights/feedback program in place Fragmented Data Sources -  Multiple disconnected systems, including Gong, Five9, Verint, Salesforce, Zoom, Google Meet, Surveys, Review Sites with no centralized integration. Product Team Lacks Customer Input -  Product team currently doesn\u2019t integrate customer feedback into the core product process. Research Synthesis Takes Long Time -  Research is being synthesized, but takes a lot of manual work and really long time. No Self-Serve Capabilities for Product -  No ability for product team to self serve understanding of customer feedback. Traditional (But Outdated) Approach Historically, teams tried to solve this with: Manual feedback aggregation Static repositories Manual linking individual feedback directly to roadmap items Problem:  This model breaks at scale \u2014 it becomes too high friction, unsustainable, inconsistent, and slows things down vs speeding things up. Goals + Outcomes 0 to 90 Days (Foundations, Q4 Planning, Initial Habit) Unify the customer voice Do:  Connect Gong, Five9/Verint, Salesforce, Zoom/Meet, surveys, and review sites; ingest historical data and enable daily sync. Outcome:  One searchable, ARR\u2011aware index of customer feedback powering product decisions; no more hunting across tools. Eliminate manual synthesis Do:  Automated theming, ARR\u2011weighted impact, sentiment, and trend detection. Train team on use of Insights chat. Outcome:  Time to answer top customer questions drops from months \u2192 minutes; 0 manual synthesis decks required. Equip Q4 planning with evidence Do:  Insights ready for Q4 planning. Exec ready dashboards. Outcome:  100% of Q4 briefs/goals include customer evidence tied to the problem Personalize Insights views by ownership Do:  Stand up \u201cFeedback Rivers\u201d (Slack/email) per PM/team with anomalies and new themes for their areas. Outcome:  100% of PMs subscribed and viewing weekly; each team sees a feed of customer feedback where they work. Build the weekly habit Do:  Train teams; add an \u201cInsights check\u201d to PRD/review rituals; create lightweight governance (\u201cno PRD without evidence\u201d).

    "text": "Answers  1. Brand Personalization and User Experience Currently, the AI interviewer feels quite generic. It would be highly valuable to be able to  customize the interface and persona  to better align with our brand and user experience expectations. Example improvements: allowing us to  add a branded avatar , select tone or personality presets, and modify introduction messages. We could have customization of the avatar (the 3 colors easily, but a bit limited in options outside of that). There is probably more general page theming we could support in the future if the desire is to use our hosted interviewer page vs embedding in the widget. Introduction messages are also something we could have better support of. With 11labs even there is a way to set the \"First message\" vs having it generate the first message dynamically based on the interview goals. Personalization of the agent is something I wouldn't want to invest into much in the short term. I think this fits more into our eventual agent we're planning to build which should give us more control over this aspect of the agent. This would help users perceive it as a genuine Voicemod interaction rather than an external tool, increasing engagement and trust.   2. Translation and Localization Translations are still inconsistent and not fully natural in some languages. What languages were they having trouble with? Any specifics about the user's localization and chosen language would be great. We have added better handling for Spanish(in Spain) for example.   3. User Identification and Screening Limitations One of the biggest limitations for us is the  lack of user metadata and screening options . We currently launch the in-app notification to a specific segment (e.g., users who created at least one voice in Voicelab), but once they land on the Reforge tool, we  lose all segmentation context . This might be something we already could support through our \"Identity\" endpoint where they can pass more of this metadata which we would then map to via the email address entered. We don\u2019t have access to basic information like  country, age, main use case, or app version , which are essential for contextualizing responses. If they don't want to pass this, it would be pretty quick to pass an identifier through URL param or widget initialization action Ideally, there should be a way to  pass metadata or identifiers  from our app to the Reforge session (e.g., via parameters or API integration) so that responses can be analyzed by user segment.  4. Data Export and Sharing Pain Points The inability to  download audio clips or complete interviews (audio + transcript)  is a major blocker for stakeholder sharing and analysis. Our reporting process relies on  embedding audio/video snippets  and showing both the  question and answer  for context. This has been an open question and haven't been given a specific product decision on if we should support it yet. Allowing the user to download the full interview audio would be",
