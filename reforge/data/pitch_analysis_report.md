## Q1 2026 Pitch Performance Report

**Calls Analyzed:** 7 (1 empty transcript - Evergive)  
**Time Period:** Q1 2026 Jonathan Greenberg Calls

## Executive Summary

The "Product Discovery Agent" pitch is **landing well with strong problem resonance** (avg 7.7/10) but the **"Product Debt" enemy framing is severely underutilized** (only 2 of 7 calls). When Product Debt IS mentioned, it resonates 100% of the time.

**Key Finding:** Larger companies (500+) have the strongest problem resonance (8.5 avg) and enemy clarity (7.0 avg), but the pitch is being delivered inconsistently across company sizes.

### Aggregate Scores
| Dimension | Average Score |
|-----------|--------------|
| Problem Resonance | **7.7**/10 |
| Enemy Clarity | **4.4**/10 ← Opportunity |
| Product Understanding | **7.3**/10 |
| Next Step Quality | **7.1**/10 |

## Messaging Analysis

### "Discovery Deficit" Framing

**Usage Rate:** 5/7 calls (71%)  
**Resonance When Used:** 4/5 strong (80%)

The discovery deficit framing works best when Jonathan contrasts AI-accelerated execution with manual discovery:

> *"It's gotten a lot faster and easier to go and ship code, you know, validating and understanding what to ship is kind of becomes the difficult part and where we see a lot of friction in ecosystems right now."*  
> — Jonathan on DreamHost call

**Best Reception:** Companies already using AI for coding (Maestro, Ecovadis) immediately understood the asymmetry.

---

### "Product Debt" as the Enemy

**Usage Rate:** 2/7 calls (29%) ⚠️ **SEVERELY UNDERUTILIZED**  
**Resonance When Used:** 2/2 (100%)

This is the biggest opportunity. When Jonathan mentioned sunset products or validation failures, prospects deeply connected:

> *"Having that, it's just really difficult to prove the value of a product before it goes out. And so, any data that you could do and anything that you could do as fast as possible is absolutely, you know, a real pain point and worth focusing on."*  
> — Ralph, DreamHost (described as "product legend")

**Recommendation:** Make "Product Debt" a consistent part of every call's framing.

## What Resonated (By Message)

### 1. Speed/Velocity of Validation (6/7 calls)
**Most Universal Appeal**

| Company | Quote |
|---------|-------|
| Maestro | *"any speed increase any, you know, velocity that we can gain the better. And I think that's why frankly, we're here"* |
| Console | *"feedback triage basically is like the thing that I'm looking for. We've been doing everything manually to date and it's just, it's like breaking."* |
| Datadrew | *"what would have taken months. We want to release those products in days."* |

### 2. Discovery → Build → Research Loop (5/7 calls)
**Strategic Resonance with Larger Companies**

| Company | Quote |
|---------|-------|
| Ecovadis | *"what would be interesting to see is that you seem to be offering kind of an end to end solution. So, starting from gathering insights up until clients interviews after the prototyping"* |
| Maestro | *"a demo ware when we build it gets us much faster validation cycles than anything else"* |

### 3. Breaking Down Silos (4/7 calls)

| Company | Quote |
|---------|-------|
| Brigit | *"one of the things that I'm here to do is help bridge the gap between all of our research and so not only marketing but how can we use those data insights to help inform some of the product which feels very siloed right now"* |

### 4. Categorization/Theme Automation (4/7 calls)

| Company | Quote |
|---------|-------|
| Console | *"I basically want to collect feedback, automatically, have it be categorized into features slash problems automatically with AI. So you could have like 10 pieces of feedback all being grouped into like one problem statement."* |
| EvenUp | *"the most important part of my feedback tracker isn't just getting the data. It's like are we categorizing it in the right categories?"* |

## Objections & Concerns

### 1. Integration with Existing Workflows (5/7 calls) ⚠️ **MOST COMMON**

| Company | Concern |
|---------|---------|
| DreamHost | *"our organization is very focused on clickup. We migrated to it about a year and a half two years ago, and it's kind of central to how we organize all of our work"* |
| Console | Theme hierarchy needed - *"a flat list of themes is hard to work with"* |
| Maestro | *"there's sort of certain limitations to how far kind of a tool like this could go to the building a secure system that would integrate"* |
| Ecovadis | *"We use product work mainly... it would be nice not to change it."* |

**Pattern:** Prospects want Reforge to fit INTO their workflow, not replace it.

### 2. Existing Tool Overlap (3/7 calls)

| Company | Existing Tool | Concern |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Brigit | Dovetail | Already using for synthesis |
| Ecovadis | Product Board | Heavy investment, don't want to change |
| EvenUp | Gong | *"Gong already has this categorization layer"* |

### 3. Build vs Buy (2/7 calls)

| Company | Quote |
|---------|-------|
| EvenUp | *"I don't think it's about time? Or resources for now because I could use like cloud code and ask it to like use bigquery to run a query"* |
| Datadrew | *"we just will use other products like maybe bolt or lovable as of now"* |

### 4. AI Interviewer Skepticism (2/7 calls)

| Company | Quote |
|---------|-------|
| Ecovadis | *"it's always a bit of a thin line because it depends what you have to test, if you really have to run a usability interviews... the feedback I've been receiving it's that it doesn't really work because it's it remains quite artificial."* |

## Segmentation Analysis

### By Company Size

| Size | Problem Resonance | Enemy Clarity | Next Step Quality |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 51-200 | 7.5 | 3.5 | 7.25 |
| 201-500 | 7.0 | 3.0 | 7.0 |
| **500+** | **8.5** | **7.0** | 7.0 |

**Insight:** Larger companies have deeper problem awareness and respond better to strategic "enemy" framing. Smaller companies want tactical speed improvements.

### By Buyer Persona

| Persona | Problem Resonance | Enemy Clarity | Next Step Quality |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Product Leader** | **8.5** | **5.75** | **7.75** |
| Designer/Researcher | 7.0 | 3.0 | 5.0 |
| Product Analyst/PM | 6.5 | 2.5 | 7.0 |

**Insight:** Product Leaders are the best audience for the strategic pitch. Analysts/PMs want to see specific capabilities proven.

### By AI Adoption Level

| Level | Problem Resonance | Key Insight |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| High | 7.0 | See Reforge as one of many tools; focus on capability gaps |
| **Moderate** | **8.5** | Most receptive - see execution speeding up, discovery falling behind |
| Low | 8.0 | Integration concerns; longer decision cycles |

**Insight:** **Moderate AI adopters are the sweet spot** - they've experienced the execution speed-up but haven't solved discovery yet.

   - 500+: Lead with strategic loop, product debt, long-term vision
   - 51-200: Lead with speed, automation, time savings

3. **Tailor pitch by persona:**

### Product Gaps Identified

| Gap | Requested By | Priority |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Clickup integration | DreamHost | High (blocking) |
| Theme hierarchy/nesting | Console | Medium |
| Urgent vs strategic feedback distinction | Console | Medium |
