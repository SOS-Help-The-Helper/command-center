# Reforge Call Analysis Report - Q1 2026

**Analysis Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Calls Analyzed:** 24 external calls (Jonathan Greenberg)  
**Date Range:** January 7-30, 2026  
**Source:** Gong API transcripts

## Executive Summary

### 🔥 BIG INSIGHT
**"Product Debt" has 100% resonance but you only used it on 33% of calls.**

When Jonathan uses the "Product Debt" framing, it lands every single time. But it's only being deployed on 8 of 24 calls. This is the sharpest positioning weapon collecting dust.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Lead with "Product Debt" framing on EVERY discovery call.

## Prototype Tool Evaluation History

### Tools Mentioned (14 of 24 companies have evaluated before)
- **Replit** - Ecovadis tested, teams excited
- **Lovable** - Maestro CEO is power user
- **ProductBoard** - Console found too manual/expensive; Ecovadis uses actively
- **Dovetail** - Brigit uses for AI synthesis
- **Figma** - Multiple companies use for prototyping
- **Maze** - Brigit uses for user testing
- **Cursor** - EvenUp building own solution

### Common Issues with Existing Tools
1. **Too expensive** (ProductBoard at scale)
2. **Not collaborative enough**
3. **Doesn't integrate with existing stack**
4. **Learning curve too steep**
5. **Too manual** (ProductBoard)

## Positioning Resonance Analysis

### "Discovery Deficit" Framing
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Times Used | 17 of 24 calls (71%) |
| Times Resonated | 14 of 17 (82%) |

**Best Quotes:**
> "It's gotten a lot faster and easier to go and ship code... validating and understanding what to ship becomes the difficult part."
> — Jonathan on DreamHost call

> "Feedback triage basically is like the thing that I'm looking for. We've been doing everything manually to date and it's just, it's like breaking."
> — Fred Kang, Console

### "Product Debt" as Enemy ⚠️
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Times Used | 8 of 24 calls (33%) |
| Times Resonated | **8 of 8 (100%)** |

**Best Quotes:**
> "It's just really difficult to prove the value of a product before it goes out. Any data you could do as fast as possible is absolutely a real pain point."
> — Ralph Castro, DreamHost (27+ years in product)

> "The team has had low adoption to some of the secondary features... people are still thinking like Brigit is only like 50 dollars in cash"
> — Sarah Argus, Brigit

> "Looking back, it was well, if we could have cut the cost of development for that feature... Like could we have avoided that?"
> — Prasanth Ramanand, Maestro

## Messages That Resonated Most

### ✅ What Works
1. **Discovery can't keep up with engineering** — The core thesis lands consistently
2. **Product Debt framing** — Every feature without validation becomes debt
3. **Suite/Loop concept** — Insights → Prototype → Research → Iterate
4. **AI interviewer honesty** — "People feel more comfortable giving negative feedback to AI"
5. **Democratizing insights** — Break down silos between departments
6. **Prototyping without developers** — PM/designers can create demoware

### ❌ What Doesn't Land
1. **"Replace all your tools"** — Companies want integration, not disruption
2. **"AI will fully automate discovery"** — Too futuristic, skepticism
3. **Generic PM training pitch** — When they want tools, don't pitch learning

---

## Top Objections (by Frequency)

### 1. Integration with Existing Tools (12/24 calls - 50%)
**Examples:**
- "Our organization is very focused on ClickUp... it's central to how we organize all our work" — DreamHost
- "We use ProductBoard mainly... it would be nice not to change it" — Ecovadis
- "We use Linear" — Console

**Recommended Handling:**
- Emphasize API flexibility and data warehouse integrations
- Mention Zapier workarounds
- Position as complement, not replacement
- Highlight upcoming integrations on roadmap

### 2. Already Have Similar Tool (8/24 calls - 33%)
**Tools mentioned:** ProductBoard, Dovetail, Maze

**Recommended Handling:**
- Acknowledge their existing investment
- Position Reforge as the "action layer" on top of insights
- Emphasize unique prototyping + feedback loop
- Offer integration paths vs. rip-and-replace

### 3. Price Concerns (5/24 calls - 21%)
**Examples:**
- "Price prohibitive" — Halo (CPTO comment)
- "Budget is around 60K annual" — Neo Financial (vs. 250-300K list)

**Recommended Handling:**
- Flexible packaging (individual modules vs. suite)
- Volume-based pricing for high-volume companies
- Demonstrate ROI of faster validation
- Offer pilots to prove value

### 4. AI Interview Limitations (3/24 calls - 13%)
**Examples:**
- "It doesn't really work because it remains quite artificial" — Ecovadis (for usability testing)

**Recommended Handling:**
- Position AI interviews for follow-up feedback, not usability testing
- Emphasize the "honest negative feedback" benefit
- Show satisfaction/feature validation use cases

## Evaluation Readiness

| Status | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Ready to Evaluate | 15 | 62.5% |
| Maybe (needs more info) | 6 | 25% |
| Not Ready | 3 | 12.5% |

### What Moves Companies Forward
1. **Demo of Build tool** — Prototyping is the hook
2. **Integration documentation** — Show they can keep existing tools
3. **Clear pricing** — Remove ambiguity
4. **Pilot/trial** — Let them test with their data
5. **Champion alignment** — Product leader buy-in

### Why Companies Aren't Ready
- **Pre-revenue/early stage** (Caterina)
- **New to role** (Brigit - 3 weeks in)
- **Existing contracts** (Dovetail, ProductBoard)
- **Budget constraints** (Neo Financial)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Use Product Debt framing on every call** — 100% resonance is too good to waste
2. **Prepare ClickUp integration answer** — This came up 3 times
3. **Build ROI calculator** — Counter price objections with validation savings

### Messaging Refinements
1. Lead with "Product Debt" (the enemy) before "Discovery Deficit" (the problem)
2. Emphasize "complement, not replace" for existing tool objections
3. Position AI interviewer for feedback, not usability testing

### Best ICP Signals
- **Company size:** 500+ employees (most complex discovery needs)
- **Persona:** VP/Director of Product (decision-making authority)
- **AI adoption:** Moderate/experimenting (see the gap, not locked in)
- **Industry:** B2B SaaS, FinTech (data-driven, fast-moving)
- **Trigger:** Using AI coding tools but still manual on discovery

> "Feedback triage basically is like the thing that I'm looking for. We've been doing everything manually to date and it's just, it's like breaking."

### On Product Debt
> "It's just really difficult to prove the value of a product before it goes out."

> "The team has had low adoption to some of the secondary features"

> "If we could have cut the cost of development for that feature... Like could we have avoided that?"

### On Integration Needs
> "Our organization is very focused on ClickUp... it's central to how we organize all our work"

> "We use ProductBoard mainly... it would be nice not to change it"

### On Prototyping Pain
> "Wireframing to higher fidelity designs to getting feedback sort of like cycle... is time consuming"

> "There are times when we are bringing a developer to build some proof of concepts... which again is fairly costly"
