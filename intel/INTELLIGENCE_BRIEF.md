## Competitive Landscape Summary

### The Playing Field

| Competitor | Focus | Price | SOS Angle |
|------------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Palantir** | Surveillance | $5M+ | Different values, different buyers |
| **WebEOC** | EOC ops | $50K-$200K | Pain point: slow, expensive |
| **Veoci** | Agency workflows | $25K-$100K | Not community-focused |
| **Everbridge** | Notification | $100K+ | Notification ≠ coordination |
| **Google** | Consumer alerts | Free | Complementary, not competitive |
| **D4H** | Team readiness | Varies | Single-org, not multi-org |

### Blue Ocean Opportunity
**No competitor serves community-agency coordination well.** All are agency-focused. SOS can own the bridge between volunteers/communities and official emergency management.
